## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Code Execution Security
- **Sandboxed Execution**: All function code runs in isolated context
- **No File System Access**: Functions cannot access browser file system
- **Limited API Access**: Restricted to defined API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

### 6.2 Data Protection
- **Project Isolation**: Files isolated between projects
- **Secure Storage**: Environment variables encrypted in storage
- **CORS Protection**: Proper CORS handling for API endpoints
- **XSS Prevention**: All user content properly escaped

### 6.3 Sync Security
- **File System API Permissions**: User explicitly grants folder access
- **Path Validation**: All file paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Content Filtering**: Binary files and sensitive extensions filtered
- **Atomic Operations**: Sync operations are atomic to prevent corruption
